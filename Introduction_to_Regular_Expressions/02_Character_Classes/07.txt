Question:
Are /(ABC|abc)/ and /[Aa][Bb][Cc]/ equivalent regex? If not, how do they differ?
Can you provide an example of a string that would match one of these regex, but
not the other?

Answer:
Those two regex are not equivalent. While /(ABC|abc)/ matches only 'ABC' or
'abc', /[Aa][Bb][Cc]/ matches 'abc', regardless of the case.

For example, /[Aa][Bb][Cc]/ matches 'Abc', but /(ABC|abc)/ does not.
