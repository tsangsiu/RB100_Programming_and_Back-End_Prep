Question:
Test the pattern /\s...\s/ from the previous exercise against this text:

Doc in a big red box.
Hup! 2 3 4

Observe that one of the three-letter words in this text match the pattern; it 
also matches 2 3. Why is it that this pattern doesn't include the three-letter
words Doc, red, box, or Hup, but it does match 2 3?

Answer:
/\s...\s/ doesn't match Doc, as it doesn't start with a whitespace character.

It matches big, as it starts and ends with a whitespace character.

It doesn't match red, as the whitespace before red is consumed to match big.
Once a character is consumed, it is no longer available to subsequent matches.

It doesn't match box, as the period after it is not a whitespace.

It doesn't match Hup, as the exclamation mark after it is not a whitespace.

It does match ' 2 3 ', as it starts and ends with a whitespace, and the
metacharacter '.' matches any character.
