Question:
What will the following code print to the screen?

def scream(words)
  words = words + "!!!!"
  return
  puts words
end

scream("Yippeee")

Answer:
The code above will print nothing to the screen.

Ruby returns the evaluated result of the expression following the return
keyword, and ignores all lines after that. As it is a blank after the return
keyword, the method invocation scream returns nil. And, as there is no method
invocation specifiying what to do with the return value, the code will not 
print anything to the screen.
