Question:
Why do you get this error and how can you fix it?

Answer:
We get this error because there is a syntax error. We need an end keyword to 
close off the equal_to_four method, while the end keyword on line 6 matches with
the if..else statement.

To fix this, simlpy insert an end keyword between lines 5 and 6.
