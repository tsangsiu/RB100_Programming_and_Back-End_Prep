def meal
  'Evening'
end

puts meal

=begin

The code will print 'Evening'.

Every method returns the evaulated result, or retuen value, of the last
**executed** line. In this case, the last line is simply the string 'Evening',
which is returned by the method. The string is then passed into the puts method,
resulting in printing the string 'Evening' to the screen.
